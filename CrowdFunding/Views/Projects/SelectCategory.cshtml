        To create a project, you're required to provide your location, age, national ID, banking and tax information, email, and mailing address. This information is necessary to prevent fraud, comply with the law, and — if your project is successful — to deliver funds. Please note: after launch, your ability to edit, hide, or delete a project is limited.
